Pictures Came With NSTouchBar
=============================

First attempt at visualizing HTM anomaly results in the Apple Touch Bar.  Run the app, look at the Touch Bar (if you have one), where it will display a representation of a canned data source, and the anomaly results.

*What's with the name?*

Derived from lyrics from the Daft Punk song "Touch"
